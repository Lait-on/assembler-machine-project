# Assembler to Machine Project - C

This project simulates a machine that decodes an assembler-written code, translates it into hexadecimal, and then executes the code on a virtual machine.

## Project Objectives

The project is divided into two main steps:

1. **Decoding and translating into hexadecimal**  
   The program reads a file containing assembler code and decodes it, translating each instruction into its hexadecimal representation.

2. **Simulating a virtual machine**  
   After converting the code to hexadecimal, the program simulates the execution of the code on a virtual machine. This involves managing registers, memory, and other components of a simple virtual machine.

## Features

- **Decoding an assembler file**: Reads a file containing assembler code, identifies the instructions, and converts them into hexadecimal.
- **Simulating a virtual machine**: Executes the hexadecimal instructions on a virtual machine, managing registers and memory.

## Prerequisites

- **Language**: C
- **Operating System**: Compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Compiler**: GCC or Clang.

## Installation

1. Clone the project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lait-on/assembler-machine-project.git
